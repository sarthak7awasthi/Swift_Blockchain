# Blockchain-Based Token System

## Overview

This project is a blockchain-based token system that allows for secure management and transfer of digital assets using a simplified blockchain structure. It includes features such as smart contracts for transaction validation and automation.

## Features

- Create and manage digital assets as tokens on the blockchain.
- Implement a basic smart contract system for automated transaction validation.
- Modular code structure with separate modules for transactions, blocks, wallets, and more.
- Simulate the mining process for adding blocks to the blockchain.
- Track token balances for different addresses in a token registry.
- Basic command-line interface for interaction and testing.
